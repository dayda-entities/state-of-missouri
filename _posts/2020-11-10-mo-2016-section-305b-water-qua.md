This data set contains those Missouri waters which have been assessed as impaired in 2016, including waters on Missouri's EPA Approved 2016 Section 303(d) List, but also including waters not on that list, such as waters which have a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) or other appropriate management plan in place, or waters which are not impaired by a discrete pollutant. Missouri's EPA Approved 2016 303(d) List has received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The data set contains the names of impaired waters, their unique identification numbers and locations, and identifies specific pollutants and pollutant sources if they are known. This data set is created in conjunction with the Missouri Water Quality Report, which is produced biennially as required by Section 305(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, and correlates to Tables 14-15 of that report.

These data were formally named: MO_2014_Section_305b_Water_Quality_Report_Complete_Listing_of_Impaired_Lakes_shp.zip and MO_2014_Section_305b_Water_Quality_Report_Complete_Listing_of_Impaired_Rivers_and_Streams_shp.zip which have been removed from MSDIS at MO Office of Administration request.
