This data set provides information about wells in the State of Missouri. The parent data set is the Wellhead Information Management System (WIMS) database that is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Missouri Geological Survey (MGS), Geological Survey Program (GSP), Wellhead Protection Section (WHP). The WIMS database resulted from implementation of the Water Well Drillers Law of 1985. The information about well location, well ownership, well completion date, well construction, well yield, static water level, and borehole stratigraphy was provided by well drillers as required by state statute RSMo 256.600-256.640. Wells drilled prior to July of 1987 are not included in this data set. A WIMS Well Search is also available online at http://dnr.mo.gov/mowells/publicLanding.do

These data were formally named MO_2015_Wells_shp.zip which have been removed from MSDIS at MO Office of Administration request.
